# Project-8---Pentesting-Live-Targets

Time spent: **4** hours spent in total

> Objective: Identify vulnerabilities in three different versions of the Globitek website: blue, green, and red.

The six possible exploits are:
* Username Enumeration
* Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)
* SQL Injection (SQLi)
* Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
* Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
* Session Hijacking/Fixation

Each version of the site has been given two of the six vulnerabilities. (In other words, all six of the exploits should be assignable to one of the sites.)

## Blue

Vulnerability #1: SQL Injection (SQLi)

When looking at a salesperson's information one can inject code into the URL to stall the reloading of the page. By inserting the code 'OR SLEEP(10)=0--' the page will buffer for 10 seconds before reloading.

Vulnerability #2: Session Hijacking/Fixation

Using the tool "public/hacktools/change_session_id.php" and switching between two different browsers (chrome & internet explorer), the phpsession id of the browser that has not been logged in yet can be changed to that of one that has already been logged in therefore allowing a hacker to bypass the log-in credentials.

## Green

Vulnerability #1: User Enumeration

When a user, that does not exist, and an incorrect password are entered an error message says "Log in was unsuccessful." However when a user, that does exist, is entered along with an incorrect password the error message is bolded letting a hacker know that it is a valid user.

Vulnerability #2: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

The feedback section of the website is vulnerable to malicious code. A hacker can insert code in the "contact us" form that will automatically be executed when a verified user tries to access the feedback tab.

## Red

Vulnerability #1: Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)

By simply changing the id parameter in the URL any account becomes visible. This includes accounts of employees who have already been fired or those accounts that are not to be seen by the public yet.

Vulnerability #2: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)

The CSRF_token is not checked therfore a malicious user can change the token and still edit a salessperson's information (even from a third party like burp).

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while doing the work
The challenges were fairly easy the only problem I enconutered was multiple people working on the XSS challenge interfered with me at first.
